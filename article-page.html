      <h2>Preventing impacts of electronic waste on child health</h2>
        <p>Electronic and electrical waste (e-waste) is the world’s fastest growing waste stream. According to the Global E-waste Statistics Partnership (GESP), 53.6 million tonnes of e-waste were produced in 2019, but less than 20% was documented as appropriately disposed of or recycled. E-waste contains valuable resources, such as gold and copper, and recycling these materials has become an important source of income for those working in the informal sector. E-waste also contains highly toxic materials, such as lead and cadmium, which are released into the environment through informal recycling activities.</p>

      <h2>E-Waste Management in India: Challenges and Strategies</h2>
        <p>Electronic waste, as known as e-waste, is generated when any electronic or electrical equipment becomes unfit for the intended use or if it has crossed its expiry date. Due to rapid technological advancements and the production of newer electronic equipment, the old ones get easily replaced with new models. It has particularly led to an exponential increase in e-waste in India. People tend to switch to the newer models and trending technologies; also, the lives of products get reduced with time. But the issue is left with e-waste management in India and its challenges.</p>

      <h2>The Environmental Impact of E-Waste</h2>
        <p>E-waste recycling is the process of extracting valuable materials after shredding the e-waste into tiny pieces that could be reused in a new electronic appliance. Unfortunately, low global recycling rates and other challenges contribute to massive quantities of e-waste accumulating in landfills around the world, the environmental impact of which cannot be ignored.Electronic waste, or e-waste, is considered a “time bomb” in the present globalised world.China is the largest e-waste producer, followed by the US which has a recycling rate of just 17.4%.

      <h2>Trends of electronic waste pollution and its impact on the global environment</h2>
        <p>Toxic elements from e-waste materials, released in the air, water, and soil, include arsenic, cadmium, chromium, mercury, and lead, causing pollution. Although their roles in biological systems are poorly identified, however, they possess significant toxic and carcinogenic potential.It is therefore critical to monitor footprint and device strategies to address e-waste-linked issues from manufacturing, exportation, to ultimate dumping, including technology transmissions for its recycling. </p>

      <h2>A Systematic Review of E-Waste Generation and Environmental Management of Asia</h2>
        <p>Due to the rapid increase in the use of electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) worldwide, e-waste has become a critical environmental issue for many governments around the world. Several studies have pointed out that failure to adopt appropriate recycling practices for e-waste may cause environmental disasters and health concerns to humans due to the presence of hazardous materials. This warrants the need for a review of the existing processes of e-waste management</p>

      <h2>E-waste management: A review of recycling process</h2>
        <p>The exponential growth in electronic waste (e-waste) comprising end-of-life electrical and electronic equipment has emerged as a major environmental concern. E-waste recycling, which comprises systematic collection of e-waste and its treatment for recycling of useful materials, offers a valuable tool to minimize the escalating heap of e-waste, supplement the shortage of some primary resources and support the economy.To efficiently harness the benefits of e-waste recycling without jeopardizing public health, a holistic approach encompassing improved product design and recycling rate of hazardous e-waste pollutants to the environment is required.</p>

      <h2>New pathways for e-waste recycling</h2>
        <p>Despite growing mountains of electronic waste, only a fraction is recycled. Now, a study meshing material flow and geospatial analysis shows how e-waste pathways could be integrated with virgin mining to build viable strategies around metal supply chains.However, e-waste is not only a source of valuable materials, but also of a variety of toxic chemicals emitted during its processing and recycling. 20 to 50 million metric tons of e-waste are disposed of worldwide every year</p>

      <h2>The enormous opportunity of e-waste recycling</h2>
        <p>The United States generates about 46 pounds of e-waste per capita annually, according to the United Nations 2020 e-waste monitoring report. Globally, 53.6 million metric tons of e-waste are produced every year worldwide, the analysis estimates. Maybe unsurprisingly, but still alarmingly, only about 17 percent of this waste is properly collected, documented and recycled across the globe each year. Much of the remaining 83 percent of e-waste sits idle in homes and businesses or is disposed of improperly, according to the analysis.</p>

      <h2>E-Waste: Causes, Concerns and Management</h2>
        <p>Today, a growing amount of e-waste is not considered only to be products that have stopped working or become obsolete. Technology is advancing at such a fast pace that a lot of electronic devices that still work fine are the ones considered obsolete. The updated versions of the devices replace the older ones which then become e-waste.Electronics contain toxic substances – therefore they must be handled with care when no longer wanted or needed.</p>
